Lowest dimension gaugue-invariant operators in SU(N) Yang-Mills theories.

We look at operators of the form

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}} \supset \frac{1}{\Lambda^{k}} X Q_{i} G^{\otimes k}_{N},
\]

where \(X \equiv \left(p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{N-1} \right)\) is some arbitrary representation of \(\mathrm{SU}\left(N\right)\), \(Q_{i}\) are generalized matter fields in the i<sup>th</sup> fundamental representation, and \(G_{N} \equiv \left(1, 0, \ldots, 0, 1\right)\) is the adjoint representation. For a given \(X\) we then seek the minimum number of copies \(k\) of the adjoint such that this operator is invariant under a global gauge transformation.
